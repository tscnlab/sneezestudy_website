    "text": "About\nHave you ever sneezed when you stepped into bright sunlight? You’re not alone. Around 25% of people worldwide experience this curious reaction—known as the photic sneeze reflex, or colloquially, the “sun sneeze”.\nDespite its high prevalence, many people who don’t experience it have never heard of it. That’s part of what makes it so fascinating: it’s a widely shared phenomenon that remains largely invisible to those unaffected.\nThe Global Photic Sneeze Study is a research-driven effort to better understand why this reflex occurs, how it varies between individuals, and what mechanisms in the brain and body might explain it.\nOur goal is to combine insights from genetics, neuroscience, and sensory biology to uncover the underpinnings of this light-triggered response.\n\n\n\nContact\nAre you a researcher, clinician, or simply someone curious about the photic sneeze reflex? We’d love to hear from you!\nWhether you want to collaborate, share your experience, or learn more about the Global Photic Sneeze Study, don’t hesitate to reach out.\nEmail: manuel.spitschan@tum.de"
