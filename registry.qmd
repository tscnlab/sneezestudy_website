# About

Some people sneeze when they suddenly step into bright light -- sunlight, camera flashes, or even a bright lamp. This curious response is known as the photic sneeze reflex, or the ACHOO phenomenon (Autosomal Dominant Compelling Helio-Ophthalmic Outburst). While harmless, it remains one of the least understood quirks of human sensory biology.

The Global Photic Sneeze Registry is an international science initiative led by the [Translational Sensory & Circadian Neuroscience Unit (MPS/TUM/TUMCREATE](https://tscnlab.org/)). Its goal is to collect anonymous stories and experiences from people around the world - both those who sneeze in response to light and those who do not — to better understand how and why this phenomenon occurs.

# What we do

Through an anonymous online questionnaire hosted on the secure REDCap platform at TUM, we gather:
* Demographic information (such as age and gender)
* Structured questions on sneezing frequency, triggers and environmental contexts
* Open-ended personal descriptions of what it feels like to sneeze in response to light

Participants can also choose to share a short signature line (e.g., "It always happens when I step outside after a movie — Josh from Malibu"") to appear on this website, showcasing the diversity of experiences worldwide.

# Why it matters

Despite its seemingly whimsical nature, the photic sneeze reflex opens a window into how light interacts with the nervous system. By compiling stories and patterns from across the globe, the Registry aims to:
* Describe the characteristics and variability of the reflex
* Identify common triggers and contexts
* Lay the groundwork for future research into the underlying neural and genetic mechanisms

# Our principles
* Anonymity: No personally identifying information is collected.
* Voluntary participation: You can stop at any time before submitting your response.
* Transparency: Aggregated, anonymized data will be made publicly available following quality control and ethical review, in line with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles.

# Get involved

Do you sneeze when you look at bright light -- or do you never sneeze in light and wonder why? Your experience can help us uncover new insights into this fascinating human reflex.
